      <para>
        OVITO requires a 64-bit operating system and runs on processors with x86-64 architecture.
        The graphical user interface of OVITO requires 3D graphics hardware with support for the <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</link> programming interface (OpenGL 3.0 or newer). 
        In general it is recommended that you install the latest graphics driver provided by your hardware vendor before running OVITO as some older drivers may not fully support modern OpenGL specifications,
        which can lead to compatibility problems.

              This will create a new subdirectory containing the program files.
              Change into that directory and start OVITO by running the executable <command>./bin/ovito</command>.

              Note that Windows might ask whether you really want to launch the installer, because it was downloaded from the web and it is not digitally signed.

      <title>Running OVITO on a remote machine</title>
      <para>
        Note that the OVITO desktop application cannot be run through an SSH connection using X11 forwarding mode, because it requires direct 
        access to the graphics hardware (so-called OpenGL direct rendering mode). 
        Thus, if you try to run <command>ovito</command> in an SSH terminal, you will likely get failure messages during program startup 
        or just a black application window. 
      </para>
      <para>
        It is possible, however, to run OVITO through an SSH connection using a VirtualGL + VNC setup.
        For further information, please see the <link xlink:href="https://www.virtualgl.org/">www.virtualgl.org</link> website.
        In this mode, OVITO will make use of the graphics hardware of the remote machine, which must be set up to allow running
        applications in a desktop environment. Please contact your local computing center staff to find out whether 
        this kind of remote visualization mode is supported by the HPC cluster you work on.

      <title>Installing the Python module</title>
      <para>
        The <emphasis>OVITO Pro</emphasis> program packages ship with an integrated Python interpreter ("<command>ovitos</command>") that gets installed alongside with the graphical desktop application,
        allowing you to execute Python scripts written for OVITO. 
        Optionally, it is possible to install OVITO as a Python module into an existing Python interpreter on your system in case you would like to make use of 
        OVITO's functionality in scripts written for other interpreters (e.g. the system Python interpreter or <emphasis>Anaconda</emphasis>).
        Please refer to the <pydoc-link href="introduction/running" anchor="installing-the-ovito-module-in-your-python-interpreter" no-pro-tag="1">scripting manual</pydoc-link> for more 
        information on the setup procedure.

                This error typically is a result of broken symbolic links in the <filename>lib/ovito/</filename> subdirectory after 
                extracting the OVITO installation archive on a computer different from the target machine. Solution: Extract the
                OVITO installation archive right on the target Linux machine. Do not transfer the extracted program directory between computers.

This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
Available platform plugins are: minimal, offscreen, vnc, xcb.</screen>
                OVITO cannot find the <filename>libxcb-*.so</filename> system libraries, which might not be preinstalled on some Linux systems.
                Solution: Install these libraries using the system's package manager. On Ubuntu/Debian systems, for example, run the terminal command:
                <screen>
    sudo apt-get install libx11-xcb1 libxcb-glx0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 \

        <emphasis>OVITO Basic</emphasis> is available under an Open Source license and you can download the source code
