Data object types
=================

A dataset loaded into OVITO from a simulation file may consist of several individual *data objects*, which represent different
facets of the information, e.g. the simulation cell geometry, the atomic coordinates, the bond list, etc. 
:ref:`Modifiers <particles.modifiers>` operate on these data objects and may add dynamically computed data objects to the dataset as it is processed in
the :ref:`data pipeline <usage.modification_pipeline>`.

Note that, in OVITO, the visualization of data is delegated to so-called :ref:`visual elements <visual_elements>`,
which are responsible for producing the three-dimensional graphical representation of the numerical data stored in the data objects.
That means data objects themselves have no configurable visualization parameters; only the :ref:`visual elements <visual_elements>`
rendering the graphical representation do.
