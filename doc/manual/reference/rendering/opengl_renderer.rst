which is also used by OVITO for rendering the interactive viewports.

Parameters
""""""""""

Anti-aliasing level
  To reduce `aliasing effects <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing>`__, the output image is usually rendered at a higher resolution
  than the final image (*supersampling*). This factor controls how much larger this
  resolution is. A factor of 1 turns anti-aliasing off. Higher values lead to better quality.
