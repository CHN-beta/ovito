The *Animation Settings* dialog can be opened from the animation toolbar:

The dialog lets you manage animation-related settings, e.g. the playback frame rate and the length of the
current animation. Note that a more detailed introduction to OVITO's animation system can be found
:ref:`here <usage.animation>`.

Settings
""""""""

Frames per second
  The playback speed of the animation in frames per second. This value determines both the frame rate of
  movie files rendered by OVITO and the playback of the animation in the interactive viewports.

Playback speed
  Controls the playback speed of the animation in OVITO's interactive viewports.
  This factor is multiplied with the frame rate (FPS) described
  parameter above. Note that the effective playback speed may be much slower if
  loading, computing, and displaying the next frame takes a long time.

Every Nth frame
  Lets OVITO skip some animation frames during playback in the interactive viewports.
  Use this to accelerate the playback of a long trajectory, where loading and computing every
  frame would take too much time.

Loop playback
  Controls whether animation playback in the viewport happens in a repeating loop.
  If turned off, playback stops when the end of the animation is reached.

Custom animation interval
  This option lets you override the length of the animation interval shown in
  the timeline of OVITO. Normally, this interval is automatically adjusted
  to the length of the loaded simulation sequence(s).
  Setting a custom animation length is useful, for example, if the simulation
  dataset consists of just a static frame (not a trajectory) but you would like to create a
  :ref:`camera animation <usage.animation>` moving around the dataset.
