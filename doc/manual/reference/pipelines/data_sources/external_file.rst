.. _scene_objects.file_source:

External file

The "External file" panel lets you configure the parameters of the data source, in particular from which external file(s) the input data for the current data pipeline should be read. 
The panel is automatically displayed after you :ref:`imported a data file <usage.import>`.
via OVITO's :menuselection:`Load File` or :menuselection:`Load Remote File` menu functions.
You can return to the panel at any time by selecting the topmost entry under the "Data source" section of the
:ref:`pipeline editor <usage.modification_pipeline.pipeline_listbox>`.

.. _file_formats:

Supported file formats
""""""""""""""""""""""

The *external file* data source can read various file formats containing different kinds of :ref:`data objects <scene_objects>`.
Furthermore, the :ref:`file export function <usage.export>` of OVITO allows you to write the results of the data pipeline to
disk in various output format:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  ../../file_formats/file_formats_input
  ../../file_formats/file_formats_output

Pick new file
  Selects a different data file on disk, which will subsequently serve as new input for the current
  data pipeline. All modifiers in the pipeline are preserved but the input data they operate on gets replaced.

  Note that OVITO is *not* going to detect whether the new file you've picked is part of a numbered file sequence in the same directory. 
  You should manually check the :guilabel:`auto-generate` box if you want to load a numbered file sequence.

Pick new remote file 
  Same as above, but lets you load simulation data from a new remote URL instead of picking a file in the local filesystem.
       
Reload file   
  Refreshes the data for the current animation frame from the external file. This function is useful
  if the file contents have been updated or replaced, for example after re-running a simulation or editing the file in an external program.
   
Update trajectory frames   
  Refreshes the sequence of animation frames. OVITO will search the directory to find new files matching the filename pattern and/or 
  rescan the loaded file to discover any new animation frames that have been appended to the trajectory file.
    
Load entire trajectory into memory
  This option lets OVITO load all frames of the current trajectory into memory to speed up 
  access to the data or enable smooth animation playback in the interactive viewports.
  Note that you should make sure first that your computer has sufficient free memory to hold all
  trajectory frames. If this option is turned off (the default), OVITO holds only a single frame
  of the trajectory in memory at a time to reduce the memory footprint.
         
File sequence - Search pattern
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This section allows you to specify a filename search pattern to load multiple files from the 
same directory as one trajectory. The search pattern must contain a single '*' wildcard character,
which will match any sequence of digits in a filename. All files matching the search pattern 
will be combined into one long trajectory, showing the contained simulation frames back to back.
See also :ref:`this section <usage.import.sequence>` on how to import simulation trajectories.

OVITO automatically generates a default search pattern for you when importing 
a file with a number it its name. You can turn this behavior permanently off 
by unchecking the "auto-generate" option.

Trajectory - Playback ratio
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After importing a new trajectory consisting of *N* simulation snapshots,
OVITO will adjust the animation interval (which is shown as timeline below the viewports) 
to the same length and show one trajectory frame per animation frame.
Thus, there will be a one-to-one relationship between imported trajectory frame and 
rendered animation frames.  

If desired, this standard 1/1 frame ratio can be changed by pressing the :guilabel:`Change`
button, which opens the *Configure trajectory playback* dialog (see next section).

.. _scene_objects.file_source.configure_playback:

Configure trajectory playback
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/scene_objects/configure_trajectory_playback.*
  :width: 40%
  :align: right
     
This dialog lets you control how the series of snapshots from the loaded simulation trajectory 
is mapped to OVITO's animation timeline. You can change the default 1:1 mapping to 
either a 1:n mapping, in which case each trajectory frame is replicated and rendered *n*
times, or to a n:1 mapping, in which case only every n-th trajectory frame will be rendered.
 
A 1:n mapping is useful for stretching a simulation trajectory consisting of relatively few
snapshots and rendering a longer movie. OVITO provides the :ref:`particles.modifiers.smooth_trajectory` modifier,
which can be applied to compute new intermediate frames by interpolating the particle positions of successive 
frames from the input trajectory.
   
A n:1 mapping is useful if the loaded simulation trajectory consists of excessively many snapshots
and you want to render a short movie showing the whole trajectory but having fewer frames. 

The :guilabel:`Static frame` option lets you extract a single snapshot frame from the 
loaded simulation trajectory. This is useful for rendering a camera animation 
depicting an otherwise static model as shown in :ref:`this tutorial <tutorials.turntable_animation>`.

See the :ref:`advanced animations <usage.animation>` section to learn more on
the difference between simulation and animation frames in OVITO.
