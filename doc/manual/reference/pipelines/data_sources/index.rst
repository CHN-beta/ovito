A *data source* is an essential part of every :ref:`pipeline <usage.modification_pipeline>` as it provides the input data that enters the 
pipeline and is passed to the modifiers. The data source of the current pipeline appears under the "Data source" section of the pipeline editor as 
depicted in this screenshot. Most of the time you will work with the *External File* data
source type, which imports the input data for the pipeline from one or more files stored on your local computer or a remote machine.
