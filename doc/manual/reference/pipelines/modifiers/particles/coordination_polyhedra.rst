This modifier computes *coordination polyhedra* around selected atoms for visualization purposes.
A coordination polyhedron is the convex hull spanned by the bonded neighbors of a central atom.

Note: The modifier creates coordination polyhedra only for currently selected particles. That means you first have to select
the particles for which you would like to generate coordination polyhedra, e.g. using the :ref:`particles.modifiers.select_particle_type` modifier.

The modifier takes into account the :ref:`bonds <scene_objects.bonds>` from the selected particles to their neighbor to build the polyhedra.
Thus, it may be necessary to create these bonds first using the :ref:`particles.modifiers.create_bonds` modifier
before applying the *Coordination polyhedra* modifier.

The coordination polyhedra generated by the modifier are so-called :ref:`surface meshes <scene_objects.surface_mesh>` and
their visual appearance, for example the surface transparency, can be configured through the associated :ref:`visual element <visual_elements.surface_mesh>`
appearing in the :ref:`pipeline editor <usage.modification_pipeline.pipeline_listbox>` after applying this modifier.

Note: This modifier has no configurable parameters.
