  The algorithm analyzes the local enviroment of each atom up to the second neighbor shell to determine the local structural type.
  The results are stored in the <literal>Structure Type</literal> particle property, with the type assigned to each atom encoded as an integer value:

  <para>
    The <emphasis>Use only selected particles</emphasis> option restricts the analysis to the
    currently selected atoms. If this option is activated, unselected atoms will be ignored 
    (as if they did not exist) and will be assigned the structure type "Other".
    This option can be useful if you want to identify defects in a crystal with a non-diamond structure, 
    but which has a sublattice that is a diamond lattice
    (and you do not want to delete atoms belonging to the other sublattice(s) for some reason).

    To classify a central atom, this structure identification method takes into account second nearest neighbors to 
    discriminate between cubic and hexagonal diamond structures. The method can be considered
    an extended version of the popular <link linkend="particles.modifiers.common_neighbor_analysis">common neighbor analysis (CNA)</link>, which is typically used to identify FCC, HCP, or BCC structures.
    However, the conventional CNA is not suited for diamond structures, because nearest neighbor atoms don't have common neighbors,
    and the second and third nearest neighbor shells are not well separated. 
    </para>
    <para>
    These problems are solved as follows: First, the nearest neighbors of an atom are identified. Then, for each of these four neighbors, their respective nearest neighbors are identified.
    This yields the list of second nearest neighbors of the central atom.
    Finally, the CNA fingerprint is computed for these 12 second nearest neighbors and the central atom.
    If they are arranged on a FCC lattice, then the central atom is classified as
    cubic diamond. If they form a HCP structure, then the central atom is marked as an hexagonal diamond atom.
