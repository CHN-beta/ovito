Histogram

  :width: 35%
  :align: right

This modifier computes the histogram of the values of a certain property, taken over all particles, bonds or other data elements in the dataset.
The modifier furthermore lets you select all data elements that fall within a specified value interval.

Parameters
""""""""""

Operate on
  Selects the class of data elements the modifier should operate on (e.g. particles, bonds, etc).
  The drop-down list will only let you select classes that are present in the modifier's pipeline input.

Property
  The source property for the histogram.

Number of histogram bins
  Controls the resolution of the computed histogram.

Use only selected elements
  Restricts the histogram calculation to the subset of particles or bonds that are currently selected.

Select value range
  This option lets the modifier perform a selection of all data element whose property values fall into the specified range.

Plot axes
  These modifier parameters control the histogram plot shown in the panel and let you zoom into
  a sub-region.
  
Time-averaged histogram
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Note that the *Histogram* modifier calculates the histogram for the current
simulation frame only and outputs it as a :ref:`data table <scene_objects.data_table>` that may vary with simulation time. 
Subsequently, you can use the :ref:`particles.modifiers.time_averaging` modifier of OVITO to reduce all per-frame 
histograms to one mean histogram, which represents the average over all frames of the simulation trajectory.
