This page of the :ref:`data inspector <data_inspector>` shows all :ref:`bonds <scene_objects.bonds>` and their property values
as a data table. The page appears only if the current dataset contains bonds.

You can dynamically filter the displayed list of bonds by entering a Boolean expression in the input field at the top of the table.
Consider, for example, the table shown in the screenshot: Here, the :ref:`Compute property <particles.modifiers.compute_property>` modifier
had been used to compute and assign the ``Length`` property to each bond (last table column).
To selectively list only those bonds that are very long, let's say longer than 1.5 Angstroms,
we can enter the expression ``Length > 1.5`` into the filter field.
Multiple criteria can be combined using logical AND and OR operators. For a detailed description of the expression syntax,
see the :ref:`Expression Selection <particles.modifiers.expression_select>` modifier.
To reset the filter and show the full list of bonds again, use the :guilabel:`X` button.

The ``Topology`` bond property contains the indices of the two particles connected by a bond.
This information may be used to select the bonds connected to a particular particle. For example to select all bonds adjacent to
the first particle (particle index 0), we could use the following filter expression::

  Topology.A==0 || Topology.B==0
