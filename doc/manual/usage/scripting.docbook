  <title>Python scripts</title>

	<para>
	   OVITO provides a scripting interface that makes it possible to automate analysis and visualization tasks. This can be useful, for example,
	   when a large number of input files needs to be batch-processed. OVITO's built-in Python interpreter allows you to
	   invoke its functions from a Python script. The scripting interface provides programmatic access to most program features 
	   such as input and output of data files, modifiers, and rendering of images and movies.

	   If you are not familiar with the Python language, you can find several tutorials and books online that cover this subject. 
	   Note that OVITO supports the Python 3.4 language standard.
