  <title>Scripting</title>

	<para>
	   OVITO provides a scripting interface that makes it possible to automate various analysis or visualization tasks. This can be useful, for example,
	   if a large number of input files needs to be processed. The program comes with an integrated Python interpreter which allows you to control
	   the program and use its functions from a Python script. The scripting interface provides programmatic access to most program features 
	   such as import and export of data files, modifiers, and rendering of images or movies.

	   If you are not familiar with the Python language, you can find several tutorials and books online that cover this subject. 
	   Note that OVITO supports the Python 3.4 language standard.
