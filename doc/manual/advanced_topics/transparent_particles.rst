Semi-transparent particles

Particles can be made semi-transparent by setting their ``Transparency`` :ref:`particle property <usage.particle_properties.special>`.
A value of 0.0 lets a particle appear fully opaque (the default), while values in the range 0.0 -- 1.0 render a particle translucent.

The easiest way to set the ``Transparency`` property to a value is inserting the :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` modifier into the data pipeline.
Simply enter the desired transparency value into the expression field and the :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` 
modifier will assign that value to all particles.

You may want to make only a subset of the particles semi-transparent. To do this, first select the particles to be made semi-transparent, 
then apply the :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` modifier. Activate its :guilabel:`Compute only for selected particles` option to restrict the assignment of the 
new ``Transparency`` value only to the currently selected particles. Unselected particles will keep their transparency values (0.0 by default).

In the example picture on this page, the :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` 
modifier was used to set the ``Transparency`` property based on a simple math formula: ``ReducedPosition.X``.
Thus, instead of assigning a uniform transparency value to all particles, each particle's value depends on its local X coordinate.
