Learn how to highlight a group of atoms, initially located in a narrow region, with a marker color to visualize the atomic motion 
in the interior of the crystal during the course of the simulation. In particular this tutorial will introduce you to the 
:ref:`particles.modifiers.freeze_property` modifier in OVITO, which helps preserving the initial selection state of a group of particles.

This tutorial teaches you how to create an animated movie of a simulation snapshot,
showing the model from all sides by slowly rotating it.
You will learn about OVITO's keyframe-based :ref:`parameter animation system <usage.animation>`
and different ways of repositioning a model in the three-dimensional scene.
