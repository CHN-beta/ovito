    OVITO can visualize particles with ellipsoid and box shapes as shown in the pictures on the right.
    In addition, particles with cylindrical and spherocylindrical (capsule) shape can be visualized.
  </para>

  <para>
    While the size of standard spherical and cubic particles is controlled by the <literal>Radius</literal> particle property,
    the size and shape of non-spherical and non-cubic particles is determined by the <literal>Aspherical Shape</literal> property.
    For OVITO to display non-spherical particles, this property must be defined and the
    desired shape must be selected in the settings of the <link linkend="display_objects.particles">Particles</link> visual element.
  </para>

  <para>
    The <literal>Aspherical Shape</literal> particle property consists of three components <literal>X</literal>, <literal>Y</literal>, and <literal>Z</literal>
    which specify the size (radius) of ellipsoidal or box particles along the three principal axes.
    Particles for which all three components of the <literal>Aspherical Shape</literal> property are zero, are rendered
    as standard spheres (or cubes). In this case their size is controlled by the <literal>Radius</literal> property, as if the <literal>Aspherical Shape</literal> property was not defined.
  </para>

  <para>
    The size of cylindrical and spherocylindrical particles is also determined by the <literal>Aspherical Shape</literal> property.
    Here, the <literal>X</literal> component specifies the radius of the cylinder and the <literal>Z</literal> component specifies its length
    (along the local Z axis). The <literal>Y</literal> component is ignored.
  </para>

  <para>
    The orientation of aspherical particles is controlled by the <literal>Orientation</literal> particle property,
    which has four components <literal>X</literal>, <literal>Y</literal>, <literal>Z</literal>, <literal>W</literal> that form
    a quaternion. If the <literal>Orientation</literal> property is not defined, or if the four components do not form a unit quaternion,
    no rotation is applied to an aspherical particle and it remains aligned with the coordinate axes.
  </para>

  <para>
    Both the <literal>Aspherical Shape</literal> and the <literal>Orientation</literal> properties are typically
    read from simulation files. The LAMMPS and LIGGGHTS simulation codes can output this information to dump files using the following LAMMPS script commands:
    <screen>   compute orient all property/atom quati quatj quatk quatw
   compute shape all property/atom shapex shapey shapez
   dump 1 all custom 100 ellipsoid.dump id type x y z &amp;
        c_orient[1] c_orient[2] c_orient[3] c_orient[4] &amp;
        c_shape[1] c_shape[2] c_shape[3]</screen>
    The <literal>quati</literal>, <literal>quatj</literal>, <literal>quatj</literal>, and <literal>quatw</literal>
    atom properties of LAMMPS need to be mapped to the <literal>Orientation.X</literal>, <literal>Orientation.Y</literal>,
    <literal>Orientation.Z</literal>, and <literal>Orientation.W</literal> properties of OVITO when importing
    the dump file. Similarly, the <literal>shapex</literal>, <literal>shapey</literal>, and <literal>shapez</literal> columns
    need to be mapped to <literal>Aspherical Shape.X</literal>, <literal>Aspherical Shape.Y</literal>, and <literal>Aspherical Shape.Z</literal>
    in OVITO. Since these properties are output as <literal>c_orient*</literal> and <literal>c_shape*</literal> by the
    dump command above, OVITO cannot set up this mapping automatically. You have to do it manually by using the
    <guibutton>Edit column mapping</guibutton> button in the file import panel after loading the dump file.
