- Create Bonds modifier: Add 'lower bound' parameter such that, when using the modifier several times, bonds with different lengths can be assigned different colors.
- Let the user configure the default colors and radii assigned to different atom types.
- The particle information applet should allow the user to click on and select bonds directly (instead of picking the two particles).
- More particle representations (e.g. open circles/rectangles)
- Save more user-defined default settings (e.g. renderer type, particle colors, math expressions).
- Scripting plugin: Add file I/O script functions.
- Add support for low-dimensional systems.

- Export of general triclinic cells to LAMMPS data/dump formats. See http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_howto.html#howto_12
- Import bond information from LAMMPS.
- Test OpenGL rendering support for more than 12 million particles.

Sha Zhendong:

- Calculation of Voronoi atomic volume
- Calculation of local atomic number density functions

Fossati, Paul C:

- is there a way to set key strokes to various settings? For example one key to add coordination analysis or 
CNA to the stack, or the ability to move the camera with the arrow keys (e. g. rotate with the arrows, pan and 
zoom with the arrows and a modifier).

Wolfgang Verestek:

- uU k√∂nnte es hilfreich sein, eigene ColorMaps einzubinden.

Tobias:

- "User-defined" modifiers (i.e. saving/loading often-needed sequences of modifiers)

Taojun:

- Plotting the value of a certain property of a certain particle versus simulation time. To make this work, 
  all simulation frames need to be kept in memory.
  
NirajGupta@my.unt.edu:

I also had a feature request, maybe you can consider adding at some point. Since you have a very quick coordination search implemented, 
would it be possible to also implement a "Compute Radial Property"? Where in one can define a radius, and define an expression, and produce a 
new channel that sums or averages over all the atoms within that radius. For instance, if I've outputted the per atom stress tensor and volume in a 
LAMMPS dump, I can specify a radius  of 10 and write an expression like sum(c_stress1)/sum(c_vol) to get an averaged stress component over all the 
atoms within a 10 ang radius, and assign that value to that atom (more realistically to that point in space). I've written a little post-processing 
tool to do this, but perhaps it would useful to other users.
