* Why is importFile a member of DataSetContainer and not DataSet?
  So for now we have to store a global DataSetContainer.
  This means we can not be sure if DataSetContainer.currentSet()
  gives the same result from one call to the next. We assume this
  for now but it would be better not to store a DataSetContainer at
  all and use only DataSet instead (especially given that the
  DataSet gives the pointer to the ViewportConfiguration).

* command line scripting:

      ovito --script foo.js # No GUI will open, ovito closes afterwards

* GUI script interface:
** notebook (like sage etc.)
** load/save file
*** for notebook, save every cell, perhaps separate by some magical comment
** access to files/modifiers loaded/created with GUI
